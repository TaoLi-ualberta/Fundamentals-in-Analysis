# Fundamentals-in-Analysis
I'm going to continue my research in siganl processing with concentration on multiresolutional signal processing. 
In this field, strong mathematical backgrounds are desperately desired. 
Therefore, in order to lay a solid foundation in math, I create this project, aiming to force myself to read some textbooks and papers in math.
I'll have short descriptions or some comments for every topics I'm focusing on. If visitors have any questions, please contact me: tao8@ualberta.ca
